	prompt.Suggest{Text: "--field-selector", Description: "Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type."},

	prompt.Suggest{Text: "--force", Description: "Only used when grace-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation."},
	prompt.Suggest{Text: "--grace-period", Description: "Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion)."},

If explicitly set to false, this flag overrides other flags that make the kubectl commands apply to uninitialized objects, e.g., \"--all\". Objects with empty metadata.initializers are regarded as initialized."},

	prompt.Suggest{Text: "--wait", Description: "If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers."},
